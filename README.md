QuickHull3D Algorithm
=====================
![3d convex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foolchi/QuickHull3D/master/pic/Icon.png)
This is an algorithm for 3d convex, using quickhull3d with the time complexity nlg(n).

Test platform:
------------------
Qt Version: Qt 4.8
Operation System: Ubuntu & MacOS

Problems:
------------------
The file system is different between Ubuntu and MacOS, so the "save zonotope" cannot run on MacOS.
The picture will save in the same directory where the program executes(often in the debug directory).
